A project for Digital Image Processing course. Uses MATLAB programming to detect crest line edges in LIDAR images. The project implements three edge detection methods to achieve this: Sobel, Canny and Prewitt. Also uses a fourth technique, Haar wavelet. Includes a report about the project purpose, the methods used to solve, runtime comparisons and the overall usefulness of the techniques employed. Additionally, includes a slide presention in PowerPoint form.
